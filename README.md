# Wind Mill Object Detection Model using YoloV8

The Wind Turbine Object Detection project aims to use computer vision techniques to detect wind turbines in aerial imagery. This project utilizes the YOLOv8 model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to accurately locate and detect wind turbines within the images or videos. The project was trained on a large dataset of labeled wind turbine images, and the resulting model has achieved **89.6% accuracy** in identifying wind turbines in new aerial images or videos.
